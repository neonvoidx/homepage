Hi, I'm neonvoid

Creator of [Eldritch](https://github.com/eldritch-theme/eldritch)

I work with cloud infrastructure and modern web technologies like React, often spending most of my days working in secret proprietary  corporate stuff (as well as Python, Docker, Terraform).

I started breaking my parents' computers when I was only 4 years old. I've always been fascinated by computers. I use to think I was the coolest kid in middle school, opening MSDOS prompts and setting the foreground color to green and background to black, living in IRC,  telnet'ing into BBS linux systems, and installing Slackware on my computer (I'm getting old I think).

I spend most of time outside of work either gaming or ricing my Linux environment for no reason. Hyprland is my home, but I like testing out new Wayland window managers and desktop environments as they become available. 

I'm always interested in learning new technologies and languages. I run my own home lab server as well for testing networking such as DNS, running a media server stack, among other things.

My intentions for this website/blog are mostly to document different things for myself, but maybe if anyone ever sees this, to help others. The content will probably range from mostly the Technology and Gaming sectors, but might include other random things.

Feel free to reach out, you can find my contacts at footer of page as well as my Github.
